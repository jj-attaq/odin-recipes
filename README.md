# odin-recipes
First project for the Odin Porject

I went a little bit beyond the scope of the instructions, I had started the css lessons on freecodecamp already so I felt comfortable enough to add a few basic inline additions like a horizontal nav bar on every page. Ideally this would be done with an external css style sheet, but I just dove in and added everything in line to every page with quick copy pasting.

I was also trying to play around with the layout of the text and photos but ran into some trouble.

I wanted my recipe photos to 'float' left, and then have the ingredient unordered lists wrap around. The issue I was having was that all the text would automatically go around the picture without and additional input, but the bullet points themselves would always overlap onto the photo.

I tried adding margins into divs, the lists themselves and all kinds of similar solutions, but to no avail. I'll have to go deeper into CSS before I can fix this problem I think.

I ended up just having the text show up under the photos so I could finish the assignment and move on.

I did add 'next' and 'previous' links to the recipes so once could go through them 1 at a time without having to go back to the home page every time.

When I learn JS, I can make a drop down recipes menu item in the nav bar.

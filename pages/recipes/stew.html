      <p>You will need the following ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          500 - 750g of <em><strong>grass fed</strong></em> beef in small
          chunks, preferably with some fat
        </li>
        <li>
          5 to 7 <em><strong>organic</strong></em> red bell peppers
        </li>
        <li>
          2 or 3 big <em><strong>organic</strong></em> carrots
        </li>
        <li>
          2 or 3 <em><strong>organic</strong></em> parsley roots
        </li>
        <li>
          1kg of <em><strong>organic</strong></em> onion
        </li>
        <li>
          500g or so of <em><strong>organic</strong></em> potato or sweet potato
        </li>
        <li>
          5 or 6 <em><strong>organic</strong></em> green onions
        </li>
        <li>a bottle of red table wine</li>
        <li>half a head of garlic</li>
        <li>
          spices like red pepper powder and even cayenne if you want a spicier
          stew
        </li>
        <li>rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have <strong>all</strong> of your ingredients washed and
        prepared, we can get started!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          start by chopping up all the produce and putting them in separate
          bowls
        </li>
        <li>
          grab your biggest pot and set it on the stove to a medium high
          temperature
        </li>
        <li>put in some butter and while it's melting get your beef ready</li>
        <li>
          the following could take a while, so feel free to dip into the wine a
          little and put on some music
          <ul>
            <li>
              put in only a few beef chunks into the sizzling butter at a time
            </li>
            <li>
              we're trying to 'brown' all the meat, leaving a bit of brown in
              the pot,<br />
              but <em>not cooking the meat through</em>, that comes later
            </li>
            <li>
              it shouldn't take more than a minute to brown each small batch of
              beef
            </li>
            <li>once that's done, we can move on to the next step!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          add in a bit more butter to the pot and once melted, <br />
          dump in the onions, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper
        </li>
        <li>
          stir the onions while they sizzle, once they're starting to get
          transluscent, it's time to move on
        </li>
        <li>
          put in your peppers and green onions now too and stir for a few
          minutes
        </li>
        <li>put in the carrots and parsley roots</li>
        <li>
          add in about half the bottle of wine and stir it all together for a
          few minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          bring the temperature down and dump in the potato/sweet potatoes
          <br />
          and add the meat back into the mix
        </li>
        <li>
          put in the rest of the wine and add
          <em><strong>only</strong></em> enough water to cover everything
        </li>
        <li>
          your stew should <em><strong>never</strong></em> boil, only simmer
        </li>
        <li>now we play the waiting game</li>
        <li>
          come back to your stew every 20 - 30 minutes and give it a good stir
        </li>
        <li>
          once the liquid has started evaporating and become more 'saucy' <br />
          you're done!
        </li>
        <li>serve and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
